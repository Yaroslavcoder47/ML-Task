There she met Hans Knoll, who was establishing a new furniture company. With Florence’s design skills and Hans’ business acumen and salesmanship, the pair, who married in 1946, grew the nascent company into an international arbiter of style and design. Florence also seeded contributions with her friends Eero Saarinen, Harry Bertoia, and Mies van der Rohe. read more Florence Knoll Florence Knoll Hairpin™ Stacking Table Florence Knoll™ Bench Florence Knoll™ Coffee and End Tables Florence Knoll™ Credenza Florence Knoll™ Dining Tables Florence Knoll™ Executive Desk Florence Knoll™ Lounge Chair NEW Florence Knoll™ Model 31 Lounge Chair NEW Florence Knoll™ Model 33 Sofa Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Benches Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Lounge Chair Florence Knoll™ Relaxed Sofa and Settee Florence Knoll™ Sofa and Settee Florence Knoll™ Table Desk NEW Florence Knoll™ Vertical Storage Here to Help Workplace Help CenterMy AccountWarranty How to Purchase ShowroomsDealer LocationsSales TeamsKnoll StoresRetailer LocationsKnoll TextilesKnoll InternationalShop for Home Company Contact UsDiscover KnollCareersInvestor RelationsNewsroom Legal Cookie Notice Privacy NoticeDo Not Sell My InformationAccessibility StatementTerms of Use Join Us © Knoll Part of the MillerKnoll collective
